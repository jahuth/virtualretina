      Project started December 2004.

********* GOALS, SCOPE OF USE *****

These programs were written to simulate retinal processing on an input
video sequence, in a customizable fashion ranking from simple spatio-
temporal linear filtering, to a precise 'biologically-inspired' model.

All this is described in the attached 'tutorial.pdf'. You should start
off with that !


********* INSTALLATION *************

See 'tutorial.pdf'.

==> Other libraries required by the software must be installed first
    on the machine:

   * you can use the provided script download_build_all.bash
       --> local installation
   * or you can manually install these libs, or part of them if you
     already have the others installed.

==> VirtualRetina is configured with CMake:

   * install cmake if it is not present yet on your machine
     (automatically done by script download_build_all.bash )
   * Configure the compilation by typing "cmake CMakeLists.txt" in the
     VirtualRetina root directory.
   * Then build the library by typing "make".

==> If you proceed to manual installation and want to change paths for
    the external libraries:

   * Modify the symbolic links in VirtualRetina/ext-lib-links/
   * OR: use the cmake GUI (program ccmake) to change the different paths.
   * OR: directly modify the paths in CMakeLists.txt and launch the
     configuration again. (Paths /usr/lib and /usr/local/lib are tested by 
     default, so require no change.)

==> That's all folks.


********* OH YEAH, BY THE WAY *****

For the occasion, I implemented some generic tools that could possibly
be used in a more global context than the retina itself  (at least by
myself :-) ). These tools include:

1) Temporal linear recursive filtering objects that can deal with
   temporal signals and/or spatio-temporal sequences.

2) Spatially-variant filtering maps that implement approximations of 
   Gaussian blurs with radially-varying scales, in a recursive fashion
   (Deriche-like filters).

3) Definition of arrays of spiking neurons, possibly with
   radially-variant density.

4) Relatively user-friendly c++ tools to attach the RELEVANT parameters
   of a C++ object to an xml file, and hence to save/load this object to xml.

5) A model for analogic synapes, and the structure to handle different
   synaptic ports, associated to direct current inputs or to synaptic
   conductances.

6) Already have all this, huh? Oh well...
