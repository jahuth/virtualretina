************** GOAL:

Hi, this is a small library that I wrote to load the multiple parameters of
VirtualRetina, a retina simulation software.
Its goal is to be able to save/load a C++ object-based architecture to an XML
tree, in which only relevant parameters should be stored (the parameters that
define the C++ objects, not necessarily ALL C++ fields of the object.)

Underlying are C++ 'xml-handling' objects that wrap the real objects, and
know how to save/load the parameters of the object that has been wrapped.


************** EXAMPLE OF USE:

Go to directory Example, read the README, follow the instructions.
Launch the program Test_Bus directly from directory Example (otherwise, the
program aborts).


************** USEFUL FUNCTIONS AND CLASSES:

... are those defined and commented in file xmlparameters.h
Other headers do not concern you directly unless you are interested in the
underlying architecture.


*************************************************************************
                            BASIC TUTORIAL
*************************************************************************


************** GENERAL PRINCIPLES

1. Generally speaking, xmlParameters++ assumes a one-to-one correspondence
between C++ objects and XML nodes. An object of class 'Toto' can be saved/loaded
from an XML element with a particular chosen name (say, "toto") and structure.
In the XML element "toto", the object’s numerical parameters are stored as
attributes, and sub-field objects are stored as sub-elements.

2. Pointers Toto* can also be initialized from the XML structure, if an element
coding for a Toto object is present in the XML file. If no such element is
present, the pointer is left uninitialized.

3. Polymorphism of pointers is possible: A given pointer Toto* can be
initialized into different specializations of a Toto (say, Toto and Tata),
according to the type of element ("toto" or "tata") present in the XML file.

4. Standard template containers such as vector<Toto> or list<Toto> can simply
be initialized by writing successive nodes "toto" in the definition file.

5. All the preceding features can be combined at will, so that one can for
example initialize a vector<Toto*> from an XML file, by writing a succession of
"toto" and "tata" nodes.


************** CLASS 'XMLIZABLE' AND FUNCTION 'XMLIZE()'

In order to be serializable to XML (we say 'xmlized'), an object Toto must
inherit from a particular base class called Xmlizable:

    class Toto: virtual public xmlParam::Xmlizable
    {
      double d ;
      int i ;
      SomeClass sc ;
    };

An Xmlizable object possesses a virtual function xmlize(), which must be 
overridden to define how it can be loaded from an XML element:

    void Toto::xmlize()
    {
      add_param (d , "name-for-d");
      add_param (i , "name-for-i");
      add_child (sc , "some-name-for-my-child");
    }
The inclusion of sub-field sc implies that class SomeClass is *also*
serializable from XML, i.e., inherits from xmlParam::Xmlizable.

Then, an element "Toto" can be initialized from an XML element of the form

      <toto "name-for-d"=2.53 "name-for-i"=2>
        <some-name-for-my-child . . ./>
      </toto>
    
    
************** REGISTRATION OF POINTERS AND CONTAINERS

xmlParameters++ offers the possibility to initialize *pointers* and *vectors*
from the XML structure, including polymorphism. In order to do so, one must
register the XML element names for the whole chain of inclusion, from pointer
and/or container to the name of the derived objects themselves.
Consider again an xmlized class "Toto" and an xmlized class "SomeClass" that
needs to initialize a particular sub-field 
    vector<Toto*> vecptr;

This can be done by writing in function SomeClass::xmlize():

    add_child (vecptr,"my-pointer-vector") ;
    xmlParam::Register <2,Toto> (vecptr, xmlParam::names("name-of-a-pointer","toto")) ;

The first template index (here, 2) indicates the 'depth' of the chain of
containers and pointers before reaching the actual object. In this particular
case, element 'vecptr' will be correctly initialized by an XML element of
the form

    <node-of-SomeClass . . .>
      . . .
      <my-pointer-vector>
        <name-of-a-pointer>
          <toto . . ./>
        <name-of-a-pointer/>
        <name-of-a-pointer>
          <toto . . ./>
        <name-of-a-pointer/>
        etc.
      </my-pointer-vector>
    </node-of-SomeClass>


************** OBJECTS WITH OR WITHOUT AN XML NAME

When an object of type 'Toto' is added in the XML structure, it is
associated to an 'xmlName', which can exist or be empty. This changes the way
the object can be loaded from a father_node in the XML tree:

(CASE 1) The 'Toto' has been associated to a non-empty string name "toto".
It will then correspond to an effective NODE in the xml tree, which will be a
child node of node father_node. The xmlized parameters of Toto will be saved
as attributes of node "toto". The xmlized object members of Toto will be
savable/loadable recursively from node "toto" considered as their father_node.

(CASE 2) the 'Toto' has been assicated to an empty string name "".
It will then correspond to no effective node in the xml tree. The xmlized
parameters of Toto will directly correspond to attributes of node father_node.
The xmlized object members of Toto will be savable/loadable from node
father_node considered as their father_node.
Be careful with this degenerated case, it leads easily to undesired behaviors.


************** POINTERS AND POLYMORPHISM

The initialization of a pointer can include polymorphism of pointed objects.
An object factory can build the appropriate derived object, by reading the
xml file. All you have to do is REGISTER in the factory each derived type you
want to be able to build.

Once the whole chain of names has been registered once, other derived types
can be registered at the end of the chain, by changing the second template
parameter of function xmlParam::Register<. . .>(. . . ), and adding only the
new registration name as second argument to the function (see next EXAMPLE).


************** NEW EXAMPLE

To illustrate those two last points, consider again the previous example.
An xmlized class "SomeClass" needs to initialize a subfield
    vector<Toto*> vecptr;
knowing that the elements Toto* can either point to an object "Toto",
or to an object "Tata" (also xmlized) derived from "Toto".
We write, in function SomeClass::xmlize():

    add_child(vecptr,"") ;
    xmlParam::Register <2,Toto> (vecptr, xmlParam::names("","toto")) ;
    xmlParam::Register <2,Tata> (vecptr, "tata") ;

In that case, element 'vecptr' will be correctly initialized by XML elements
of the form

    <node-of-SomeClass . . .>
      . . .
      <toto . . ./>
      <toto . . ./>
      <tata . . ./>
      etc.
    </node-of-SomeClass>


************* USAGE IN EXECUTABLE CODE

Once an XML architecture has been defined in a set of objects by overriding
their functions xmlize(. . . ) [see "Example/sample_classes_withXMLcode.h"],
the structure can simply be saved/loaded from an XML structure, thanks to
two functions xmlParam::save(. . . ) and xmlParam::load(. . . ).
The XML structure must first have been parsed thanks to library libxml2.
See usage in "Example/Test_Bus.cc".

USAGE OF THE LIBRARY, AS PROVIDED BY THE FILES IN DIRECTORY Example/



************* CUSTOM DEFINITION OF AN XML ARCHITECTURE

It is also possible to define various parameters from XML without an
underlying correspondence to real C++ objects, if base xmlParam::Xmlizable
objects are directly used to define the elements of the XML structure.
Parameters and filiation between Xmlizable objects can directly be defined
(outside of any function xmlize()) by using Xmlizable::add_child(),
Xmlizable::add_param(), and also their 'external' equivalents for pointers
and containers: xmlParam::add_param_custom() and xmlParam::add_child_custom().
[see xmlparameters.h]


************** INITIALIZATION AFTER XML LOAD

The main goal of xmlParameters++ is to load a number of parameters from an 
XML file. But after an object's parameters have been loaded, one often needs 
to *initialize* some internal structures of the object, depending on the
value of the loaded parameters. Theoretically, this could be done in a
second stage, independently of xmlParameters++. However, it may be convenient
to proceed to this initialization automatically, right after the load from XML.
xmlParameters++ provides two methods to do this.

The first and simpler method is to override one, or both, of the two virtual
functions present in xmlParam::Xmlizable :
  - xmlinit()
  - xmlinit_after_children()
Both these functions are automatically called after the load from XML. The
former is called before the *children* sub-fields of the object are loaded
from XML, whereas the latter is called after.

A second, heavier but more general method, is to attach custom initialization
functions to an object: see functions xmlParam::add_init(...) in xmlparameters.h.
Also, functions xmlParam::Register_init<...>(...) allow to *register* custom
initialization functions at the level of pointers or containers, to be applied
after objects are *created* from the XML load.

Both methods are illustrated in 'sample_classes_withXMLcode.h'.


************** BASIC PRINCIPLE OF THE IMPLEMENTATION

An xmlized class Toto (so, inheriting from xmlParam::Xmlizable) can be "wrapped"
by an object of type xmlObject<Toto>. It is the xmlObject<Toto> that knows how
to save/load itself from a given father_node of an xml tree, given the
specifications in Toto.xmlize().

This template formalism of xmlObject<WHATEVER> allows us to handle, in the
exact same format, pointers (TYPE*) and containers (e.g., vector<TYPE>),
simply by *specializing* the code for their wrappers
(xmlObject< TYPE* >, xmlObject< vector<TYPE> >, etc.)
Thanks to this template formalism, we can then directly serialize any
*combination* of pointers and containers, such as the vector<Toto*>
presented above.


************** GENERAL NOTE ON "INCLUSION IN THE XML STRUCTURE"

In this version (1.1) we have fixed a number of bugs/uncertain memory
allocations from version (1.0), by making clearer the concept of 'inclusion
in the XML structure':

1) A given C++ object can only be included in the XML structure *by the user*,
   through the use of any of the three functions xmlParam::add_object(),
   xmlClass::add_child() and xmlClass::add_child_custom().

2) When a 'containing' object (pointer or STL container) is included in the
   XML structure, it is possible to create its content (pointed type or contained
   elements) from an XML document. However, the created objects are not so to
   speak 'included in the XML structure'.

Example:
     Toto* ptr;
     int a;
     xmlParam::add_object(ptr,"totoPtr");
     xmlParam::Register<1,Toto>(ptr,"toto"); // don't forget that line!
     xmlParam::load(ptr, some_xml_node);     // initializes *ptr
     xmlParam::add_param_custom(*ptr,a,"one-new-param");

The last line will produce an error at execution, telling you that *ptr was not
included in the xml structure.
This sort of makes sense, because normally you have already defined all relevant
features of *ptr that you would like to load : (1) through the registration of ptr,
(2) in the xmlize() function of class Toto. So, you should never really interact
with *ptr.


************** RETRIEVING AN OBJECT'S XML NAME

As a single counter-example to the principle enounced in the previous paragraph,
you may find it useful to have access to the xmlName associated to an object which
was created by the structure, such as *ptr in the previous example. This is never
*necessary* (the save/load functionalities of the library do everything on their
own), but it can be *handy*, e.g., for display purposes.

Take the preceding example and suppose you want to display what you found when
loading from the xml file:
     Toto* ptr=0;
     xmlParam::add_object(ptr,"totoPtr");
     xmlParam::Register<1,Toto>(ptr,"toto");   // don't forget that line!
     xmlParam::load(ptr, some_xml_node);       // initializes *ptr
     cout<<xmlParam::get_xmlName(ptr)<<endl;   // displays "totoPtr"
     cout<<xmlParam::get_xmlName(*ptr)<<endl;  // *should* display "toto"

The last line will produce an error at execution, telling you that *ptr was not
included in the xml structure.
There are two possible, "imperfect" workarounds instead of that last line:

(1) ASK THE HANDLER : limited.

     cout<<xmlParam::get_handledName(*ptr,ptr)<<endl;
Precises who is the "reference" object in the xml structure in charge of *ptr.
This also works if you replace ptr by an STL container over class Toto.

This works fine in this case, but in general there is a LIMITATION: the notion of
being "in charge" does not include children objects. If class Toto has a field 
"ChildClass mychild" as part of its xml-izable structure, and you ask for:
     cout<<xmlParam::get_handledName(ptr->mychild,ptr)<<endl;
you get an error at execution telling you that ptr->mychild is NOT HANDLED by ptr.

(2) LOOK AT THE LAST USED SAVE/LOAD NAME FOR THE OBJECT : potentially dangerous.

     cout<<xmlParam::last_xmlName(*ptr)<<endl;
     cout<<xmlParam::last_xmlName(ptr->mychild)<<endl;
This will work in both cases, provided that (*ptr) and (ptr->mychild) have
actually *been* given names by the xml structure at some point (here, during the
load). 

If this is not the case, you *generally* get an error telling you that the
considered object has never been given an xmlName. HOWEVER, if you are unlucky you
may *GET NO ERROR* and recover a wrong xmlName. This can happen if the address of
the considered object ( say, &(ptr->mychild) ) was priorly that of an OLD object
which *was* indeed xmlized and given an xmlName, before being freed and the
address being re-occupied by the object considered now.
So be EXTRA CAREFUL of making no mistakes with this one: don't rely on warnings.



*************** GENERAL RULES FOR HAPPY XMLING             

(in link with next paragraph, "implementations issues")

* RULE 1 : Don't call xmlParameters on "pointed pointers"...
  ==========================================================

...or "pointed containers", or "contained pointers", etc.
Something like  xmlParam::add_object(*ptr,"yo");
            or  xmlParam::add_object(cont[3],"yo");
is SAFE if *ptr (resp. cont[3]) is a 'regular' object inheriting from
xmlParam::Xmlizable.
But it is UNSAFE if *ptr (resp cont[3]) is ITSELF a 'containing' object,
i.e., a pointer or container. Indeed, in that case, it is possible that *ptr
be destroyed without the xml wrappers knowing. To understand this rule,
read paragraph "implementation issues".

* RULE 2 : Don't call xmlParameters functions on dynamic_casts of pointers.
  ========================================================================
  
Something like  Toto *ptr;
                xmlParam::add_object( dynamic_cast<Tata*>(ptr), "yo" ); 
                // (class Tata being derived from Toto)

will almost surely lead to errors (also, it seems pretty twisted). The reason is
that  all the xmlParameters library is based on templates, so the types of the
pointers should remain coherent.
(Reminder: This does not prevent from initializing *ptr as a Tata,
 polymorphism is handled through the Register functions.)



*************** IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES + LIMITATIONS


( No need to read this unless you are really interested in implementation issues )

At the implementation level, a given object 'obj' of type XMLIZED is "included in
the XML structure" if it has *permanently* an xmlObject<XMLIZED> xmlobj wrapping
it. Then, the association between &obj and &xmlobj is permanently stored in the
static variable xmlObject_base::reverseMap.
This only happens to *user-included* objects, with one of the three functions
add_object(), add_child() and add_child_custom().

Objects created during initialization of pointers or containers are only
*temporarily* wrapped by xmlObjects, the time for the saving or loading to occur.
Then the wrappers are destroyed, as well as the corresponding association in the
reverseMap. I found this mandatory for a clean handling of memory and addresses.
The only remaining trace of this temporary wrapping is in the static variable
xmlObject_base::lastNames, which retains the assocation between (even
temporarily) wrapped objects' addresses and the xmlName used during the (even
temporary) wrapping. The only goal of this is conveniency, allowing to use
function xmlParam::last_xmlName() (which should thus be used with caution, as
explained above).

Notes: 

* Once you are done with the xml part, the reverseMap is cleared with command
  "xmlParam::delete_structure()". This also clears xmlObject_base::lastNames.
  
* Note that the map xmlObject_base::lastNames can possibly contain many more
  elements than the map xmlObject_base::reverseMap. I think this should not be a
  problem as long as you stick to moderate sized structures (under a million of
  xmlized elements :p). Else, regular calls to delete_structure() must somehow
  be made.

* Actually, when an object 'obj' of type XMLIZED in included in the XML 
  structure, the address stored in the reverseMap is not always '&obj'. If 'obj'
  is a 'regular' (= 'not containing') object, the address really stored is its
  address **as an Xmlizable object** (using static_cast<Xmlizable*>). Indeed, 
  the same object may be associated to several physical addresses, especially if
  it is based on virtual and multiple inheritances. But as XMLIZED objects all
  inherit from "virtual public xmlParam::Xmlizable", we know that each XMLIZED
  object is associated to one and only one Xmlizable* address, even if it uses 
  virtual and multiple inheritance. Naturally, a 'containing' object 'obj' 
  (pointer or container) does not have this problem, so in that case the address
  stored is simply '&obj'.


This implementation implies the following limitations:
=====================================================


[I] At most one wrapping xmlObject per xmlized object. (and so... ??)


[II] You can imagine wicked cases where the reverseMap contains an obsolete
     association, because you have destroyed 'obj' without destroying its wrapper
     'xmlobj' (and thus, the association remains in the reverseMap with the
     former address of 'obj'). 

This cannot happen if 'obj' inherits from Xmlizable, because the destructor
~Xmlizable() looks for an eventual wrapper and destroys it. However, it might
happen if 'obj' is a pointer or a container, for two reasons I can imagine:

a) 'obj' is not an object that you have declared, but created through a pointer
initialization or container addition:
   XMLIZED *ptr=new XMLIZED(); xmlParam::add_object(*ptr,...); delete ptr; 
   OR
   list<XMLIZED> ls; ls.push_back(XMLIZED());
   xmlParam::add_object(ls.back(),...); ls.pop_back(); 

NOTE THAT, FOR THESE EXAMPLES TO BE PROBLEMATIC, TYPENAME 'XMLIZED' SHOULD
ITSELF BE A POINTER OR A CONTAINER.
So most of the times, a command such as "xmlParam::add_object(*ptr,...)" 
IS safe (see "RULE 1" enounced above).

b) The compiler, being too smart, decided to destroy 'obj' as it is not used
anymore in the programs. I don't think that c++ compilers can do that, but I'm
not totally sure!?
Future workaround? To be perfectly clean, you should replace pointers and
containers by special template classes xmlParam::Ptr<XMLIZED>,
xmlParam::List<XMLIZED>, etc., which inherit from an Xmlizable, and thus destroy
their eventual wrapper when they are destroyed.
This seems tedious and fairly useless.


[III] For the moment, "re-"adding in the xml structure an already 'xml-created'
      object is useless:
        
        Toto* ptr;
        int a;
        xmlParam::add_object(ptr,"totoPtr");
        xmlParam::Register<1,Toto>(ptr,"toto"); // don't forget that line!
        xmlParam::load(ptr, some_xml_node);     // initializes *ptr
        xmlParam::add_object(*ptr,"some-new-name"); 
                  // (required line to not have the 'not added' error)
        xmlParam::add_param_custom(*ptr,a,"one-new-param");

In present state, the last line has NO EFFECT on the way ptr will be saved/loaded
from an xml document.

* If LOADING ptr with xmlParam::load(ptr,some_xml_node), *ptr will be initialized
according to the rules given by the registration of ptr: Must find a child node
"toto" (NOT "some-new-name"), and "one-new-param" will not be searched for. In
fact, the possible xmlObject wrapping *ptr is automatically destroyed before
loading.

* If SAVING ptr with xmlParam::save(ptr,some_xml_node), *ptr will be saved
according to the rules given by the registration of ptr: Save a child node
"toto" (NOT "some-new-name"), and "one-new-param" will not be saved. In fact, the
possible xmlObject wrapping *ptr is automatically destroyed before saving.

Future workaround? Is it really needed? If yes (doubtful), you must modify what
the system does when it checks for an already existent wrapper for *ptr. This is
in the functions load_Element() and save_Element() of headers
xmlobject_pointer_specialisation.h and xmlobject_container_specialisation.h

Note that in this example, you can still manually load/save *ptr (NOT ptr) from a
well-chosen xml node:
xmlParam::load(*ptr, some_other_xml_node); // modifies *ptr
in which case it will retain the custom specification you asked for in the last
two lines (look for name "some-new-name", and load parameter "one-new-param").
But who would really want to do that????
